Installation instructions for DOWNLOAD Version 5.10
February 2001
 
 
 
To load DOWNLOAD onto your machine, follow these steps:

 
   1.  Decide which directory DOWNLOAD will reside in (or create
       a new directory just for DOWNLOAD.)

 
   2.  "ftp" the files from the Cedarville site into your directory.

 
   3.  If you have not already done so, make a VOC entry for the directory
       into which you have copied the DOWNLOAD files.
 
       Note:  The rest of these instructions assume the file name for
              the directory is DOWNLOAD.SOURCE.

 
   4.  Enter:
         COPY FROM DOWNLOAD.SOURCE TO VOC BUILDDL.VOC OVERWRITING

 
   5.  Run the VOC item BUILDDL.VOC.
       This paragraph will compile and catalog all of the programs
       and subroutines used by DOWNLOAD.

 
   6.  DOWNLOAD is now installed on your system.  If you have any
       remote accounts which need to use DOWNLOAD, you will need to
       copy some VOC entries to those accounts:
           FORM.LIST DOWNLOAD.SOURCE VOCLIST
           COPY FROM VOC TO xxx.REMOTE.VOC OVERWRITING
 
       You may get a "not found" message for the following:
           PRIMOS...     Applicable only to Primos systems
 

 
Documentation is in the following files:
   download.wpd    Corel WordPerfect 9 (master copy of the documentation)
   download.pdf    Adobe Acrobat (printed from the wpd version)
   DOWNLOAD.VER    List of changes made in recent versions

        informix-mv-subscribe@oliver.com
