* Stamped: p6 rotmand, /usr/local/download, user #13226, 19 May 03, 02:17PM.
* Version 6.02
*    Added XML.VERSION option (to let users specify the layout of
*       the xml version tag, or omit it altogether).
*    Unidata/Universe now set a default zero character in their
*       configuration files.  The Unidata version of DOWNLOAD now
*       fetches this value by a call to GETENV.  Universe users may

*       in the main DOWNLOAD program.  (Typically, the value will
*       be 0, 128, or 131.)  This setting only affects WP50 and WP51
*       formatted output.
*    Bug fix (WP50/WP51 headings were not complete if NUM.VALUES
*       was used for the detail and HEADING FIELD.NAMES was used
*       to specify the headings.)
