# Unidata Utilities

All software on the site has been contributed by the various authors, none of whom offer any warranty.  I think you will find the software useful and generally of good quality.  Additional contributions are welcome (write me at rotmand@cedarville.edu).

See /ftp/download for Cedarville Download software (a tool for extracting data from Unidata files to create CSV, HTML, XML, and other formats).
