UIC - UniData Internet Connection

uic.tar.Z is a compressed tar file containing programs which enable
you to link your World Wide Web forms to the UniData database. 

This will let you use UniData via the CGI-BIN interface to do such
things as provide a search engine, visitors log, etc.

These tools include a sample form and its associated programs as well
as general purpose utility programs to parse the query, provide
a standard error message and enable either the GET or POST methods 
from forms

Load this file onto your Unix server and type the following commands:

   uncompress uic.tar.Z
   tar xvf uic.tar

Then read the readme.txt file for information about the contents of
the tape archive.
