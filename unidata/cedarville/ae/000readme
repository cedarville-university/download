The files in this directory let you add the following commands to the
AE editor in the Unidata database environment:

$BL xxxx              Locate the previous occurrence of 'xxxx'

$CONV                 Apply dictionary conversion to the current field

$CRT TTT ... ZZZ      Insert CRT statements for 'TTT', ..., 'ZZZ'
                      For example, issuing "$CRT K.FILE X.SAM" will insert
                           CRT 'K.FILE: ':K.FILE
                           CRT 'X.SAM: ':X.SAM

$CRTI TTT ... ZZZ     Same as $CRT, but also insert an INPUT statement

$DEBUG TTT ... ZZZ    Insert an IF statement which checks @LOGNAME
                      before displaying the variables.
                      For example, if programmer 'jones' issues the command
                      "$DEBUG X.RATE", these lines will be inserted:
                           IF @LOGNAME = 'jones' THEN
                              CRT 'X.RATE: ':X.RATE
                           END

$DEBUGI TTT ... ZZZ   Same as $DEBUG, but also insert an INPUT statement

$DICT                 Display the dictionary name for the current field

$E mmm nnn            Execute paragraph lines (current line or the lines
                           specified by mmm-nnn)

$FOR ZZZ              Insert standard FOR loop using the value-list ZZZ
                           for the controlling list

$L n xxxx             Locate the next 'n' occurrences of 'xxxx'

$OCONV n xxxx         Apply OCONV function 'xxxx' to next 'n' lines

$P n                  Display 'n' lines, showing dictionary names and
                          field values

$P n CONV             As above, but apply dictionary conversions

$READ xxxx            Insert standard READ and PARSE paragraphs for
                          file 'xxxx'

$READU xxxx           Insert standard READU and PARSE paragraphs for
                          file 'xxxx'





To install these commands:

1.  Copy all items starting with '$' into the file AE_XCOMS.

2.  Copy all items ending with 'AE' into a source directory.  Compile and
    catalog these items.

3.  If you do not already have it, obtain 'GET.UNUSED.SELECT.LIST' from
    the Cedarville subroutines directory.  Compile and catalog this
    subroutine.
