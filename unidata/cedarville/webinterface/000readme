The files in this directory are intended to serve as examples of
how Cedarville University connects Unidata information to its Web site.
We have deliberately omitted some of our routines (such as the ones
which validate the username and password) for security reasons.
We are not able to provide assistance in getting your site setup,
but trust that the information here will get you started.


Files which would be loaded on the Web server:
constants.ph            pathnames, remote-shell user names, etc.
defaults.ph             default fiscal year, number of months, etc.
shared.ph               shared subroutines
testtransaction.ph      sample application

Files which would be loaded on the Unidata host:
CALLUB.CUSTOMER.LOOKUP  routine which performs the customer lookup/display
CALLUB.MASTER           master routine which accepts the remote shell command
                        line and calls the appropriate subroutine to
                        lookup records, format Web pages, update files, etc.


The users ('adam' and 'eve' in these samples) need to be setup on your
Unidata host.  The default shell for these users is an executable file
which invokes Unidata.  For help in creating this executable, see
the 'uic' instructions on this site (/pub/unidata/unidata).
