SysLink, a quick overview
=========================

 SysLink is an ActiveX Server for Pick/UniVerse/UniData.
 It allows you to develop a Visual Basic application
 based on the COM model with all verbs and functions
 you need to drive the database (open, read, write, call, ...).

Download a free version
=======================

 The file to download is slb2a.zip. The software contains
 long files names. Please use winzip v6.x (http://www.winzip.com)
 to extract the file. Create a temporary directory on your PC,
 unzip the slb2a.zip file and run the setup.exe program.

Windows software configuration
==============================

 The ActiveX Server runs under Windows 95 or NT 4.0.
 The client (the final windows application) is connected to
 a remote host (the nf2 database) via a serial or telnet
 link or via an OLE tool like ObjectCall or uvObjects.

Remote host software configuration
==================================

 The slave program that executes the windows requests
 is tuned for :

    * Advanced Pick Nat, Dos and Unix (6.x and D3)
    * DataStage
    * jBASE (Linux version)
    * Mentor MOE
    * R83
    * UniData Unix/NT v3 & v4
    * uniVerse Unix/NT

Demo program
============

 A Visual Basic demo is provided. You don't need to have VB
 installed on your PC to run the demo. To read/modify the demo
 program, you need the VB5.0 32-bit version.
 An Excel demo is also available.

Winsock
=======

 The winsock link is based on the cswsk32.ocx file from
 Catalyst Development Corporation. Please note that you
 can find all the tools you need to create winsock/internet
 applications on http://www.catalyst.com.
