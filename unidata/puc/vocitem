Subject: SA: Voc Items for User Remotes

While dining around at DUG last Sunday evening I got two requests for 
this list so I figured there may be a couple more schools out on the list 
that could use it, so here goes - it's regarding which Information voc 
items we give our users with : prompt access.

Here are the lists I promised you.  The first list contains all the voc 
items we allow a User remote that has : prompt access to have.  The 
second list they have also, but first we modify field 4 to contain the 
name of a security routine.  The routine checks to make sure the voc 
item is being run by someone with a programmer login or from a program, 
this keeps the user from running it from the : prompt.  We are on a 
Prime running Information 7.0.3.

If you have any questions just ask, I'll try to answer them :)
