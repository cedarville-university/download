000readme for PRINT.PAGE version 4.0



The files in this directory are used to generate a utility we call
PRINT.PAGE.  This utility is a page-formatting program which produces
standard-layout documents from Unidata files.  In its simplest form,
you just create a text file showing where you want the fields to print,
and PRINT.PAGE will position the fields in those locations.  There are
lots of more-sophisticated options, as detailed in the Acrobat
documentation file.

You are welcome to use the program on your system, redistribute it,
etc.  You are not allowed to sell the program or any derivative of
it.


To install the software:

1.  Create a directory named PRINT.PAGE.SOURCE on your Unidata system.

2.  Fetch all of the files from the ftp site to the PRINT.PAGE.SOURCE
    directory on your Unidata system.

3.  Copy the paragraph PP.INSTALL from PRINT.PAGE.SOURCE to your VOC
    file:
         COPY FROM PRINT.PAGE.SOURCE TO VOC 'PP.INSTALL'

4.  Invoke the install paragraph by typing:
         PP.INSTALL
    at the colon prompt.  Enter PRINT.PAGE.SOURCE when prompted for
    the directory name.
