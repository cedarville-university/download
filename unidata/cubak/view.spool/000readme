VIEW.SPOOL 000readme

The VIEW.SPOOL program lets users view their own spool files
and make alterations (eg, change destination) without requiring
use of cryptic Unix commands.

Since VIEW.SPOOL works with HPUX's spooler, I assume it would take some
modification of the C functions to get it running under another
Unix or spooler.  It reads the spool queue file directly (ours is
/usr/spool/lp/outputq) to find out the attributes, etc.  It issues
lpalt commands to change jobs, so whatever lpalt will let you do,
this program would be able to do.  (This version changes destination
and the number of copies.  It also lets users view their spool files
without being able to edit them.)

All of the files you need are in this directory...individually
and in a "package".  The packaged version can be unpacked on your
host using the FTP.EXTRACT program (get the extract program from
our '/ftp' level).  Note that you should have some "C" experience
before attempting to install VIEW.SPOOL.


Here is the "help" screen from VIEW.SPOOL:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
:VIEW.SPOOL -HELP
 
VIEW.SPOOL provides an alternative method to control spool queueentries.
 
The command may be entered without any options, or the following
options could be used:
  -USER user [user]       (restricts viewing to those users only)
  -FORM form# [form#]     (restricts viewing to those forms only)
  -MENU
  -OPTIONS FORM form# newFormName
  -OPTIONS COPIES form# #copies
  -OPTIONS CANCEL form# [form#]
  -OPTIONS VIEW form# [form#]
  -OPTIONS LIST
  -OPTIONS EDIT form# [form#]
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Our users use it in the menu mode, which looks like:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
:VIEW.SPOOL -MENU -USER
Display spool queue entries                                         VIEW.SPOOL
 
Request Time   User        File                 No Size    Queue

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The (ED)it option only display & works for "authorized" users.

Since it also takes command line options, I use it to edit spool
files directly from the colon prompt.  The following command would
edit (using vi) job #3584 listed above (actually spool entry
LABEL3-3584).

   :VS -OPTION EDIT 3584

I have a VOC item ESP that I use all the time:

   S
   VS -OPTION EDIT

I will put the UniBasic source & C source in a directory on our
anonymous ftp site, ftp.cedarville.edu in the directory
/pub/unidata/cedarville/view.spool.  If you get it, let me know if you
find it useful.
